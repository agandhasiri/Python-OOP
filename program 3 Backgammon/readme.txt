Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:

Program starts by asking the grid size. With the grid size it creates a canvas with
a color "burlywood4" and name "Backgammon". The code has five steps, first step
is to add two rectangles with a grid size space between them and borders,
with color "naavajowhite" with appropriate width and lenght.
Second step is adding triangles in to the rectangles by using for loop. 
i have done the upper trianges with the polygon instance and cloned for down triangles, rotated and moved to 
the corner of the rectangle to appropriate location, so that every triangle will be set in the recatangles.
for choosing the color i have used if  - else  eith even -odd condition. Third step is to draw circles,
i have done it as you have mentiond in the assignment, thanks to you, it made easy for me. Though i had no clue
about that loop, i tried and understood it later. The for loop contains number of circles, x- coordinates and to 
set color. Inside the loop, i tried to add all the upside circles and down side circles simultaneously.
setting the color for these circles was hard, though i figured it out. I think it could be done in a better way.
Next i have added numbers using two text instances, i have used that code because wanted to add the upper numbers 
and lower numbers simultaneously. It could be done in better way using lists or some other way, but it lookes 
simple and easier for me, sorry for that. At last i have added the line which divides the Canvas in to two halfs
 with simple path instance.


Regarding bugs, i have given floating points as grid sizes and checked, i see some misplacement of triangles for 
some floating points and for some folating points it was perfect.  i have checked this at the last moment, 
otherwise i would have corrected it or asked for your help, Thank you.

Other comments or response program-specific questions:

First of all i had no clue  about various uses of for loop. 
It is good if we have different uses of for loop written in book.
I couldn't add two texts in two differnt places at one time using Text module.
