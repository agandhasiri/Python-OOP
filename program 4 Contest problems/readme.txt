Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:

I've been everywhere man:
Prorgram starts with taking no of test cases. A for loop to run all the cases,
a while loop for each case to enter all the trips. A list to add all the
distinct names. count all the names given and if the count of given names equal to
no of work trips(n), break the while loop. Add every list length to another list.
then print all the values(lenghts), which are in the list outside the loop.

Hot hike:
Input has continuous numbers with spaces, so i have used split and a for loop to convert all
to integers. A list to store all int values. A for loop to check for the least warm
for two hike days. Assigning least temp as max temp every time in the loop so that we end up
with least temperature. Assign a value to find the start day and change it to iteration value
in the loop. At last print start day and maximum temperature from the two hiking days.
 

Hanging out on the terrace:
Split the input which has two integers, first int is fire safety limit and second int
is no of events. A list for all the denied groups. A for loop for all the events
if count of people in the party is less than the fire safety limit,allowing a group
depends on "enter" or "leave" and count of people already in the party if a group is
denied, it is added to the list. At last the length of the list(denied groups)
is printed.

Symmetric order:
I have done this program by using lists because it is easy and simple to manipulate lists.
First a normal list for all the given names. Manipulated this list with steps and added
to a new list. A total list to add all the arranged lists. A for loop for total list and
an inside loop for arranged lists to print all the arranged names.

The easiest problem is this one:
A while loop for input until unless input equals to zero. In the while loop, a while loop
for getting the p value. For loops for adding the sum of digits. Checks whether sum of
digits of Nis equal to sum of digits of N*p, if not p increases and checks again. If it
is equal then the answer is the current p value. A list of all the answers for all the inputs.
A for loop to print all the p values in the list

I have written all the programs to be simple and clear and all the comments clearly.
