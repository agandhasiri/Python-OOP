Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:

In the init method, there are four attributes position x, position y, velocity x,
veloxity y.
In the advance method the attributes are changed according to the desired movement,
the x, y positions are changed by adding the new given x, y values and the
velocity y is changed by adding gravity.
the other methods (get methods) just returns the latest values of positin x, position y,
velocity x and velocity y of the ball.
